## 2024-05-22 - Improving Modal Usability
**Learning:** Users instinctively click the backdrop to close modals. The lack of this behavior in the "Notes" component creates friction and inconsistency with standard web patterns.
**Action:** Implemented "click-outside-to-close" on the Notes modal and plan to extend this to other modals (Block Issue, Conflict Resolver) in the future.
