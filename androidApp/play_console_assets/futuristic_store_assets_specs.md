# Futuristic Play Store Asset Specifications

## Overview
This specification defines the "Cyber-Interface" style for the Play Store assets (Feature Graphic and Screenshots). The design intent is to present the "QA Verify and Track" application as a high-tech, military-grade, or sci-fi era development tool. It features a polished, "glass-hologram" aesthetic often seen in AAA sci-fi games (e.g., Mass Effect, Halo, Cyberpunk 2077).

## Aesthetic ("The Glass HUD")

### 1. Visual Language
*   **Background:** Deep Space Blue (`#020205`) with a subtle "Hex-Field" overlay.
*   **Materials:** Semi-transparent "Glass" panels with 1px Cyber Cyan borders.
*   **Accents:**
    *   **Success/Online:** Neon Green (`#00FF44`) or Cyan (`#00F0FF`).
    *   **Error/Critical:** Laser Red (`#FF0033`).
    *   **Warning/Processing:** Amber (`#FFCC00`).
*   **Typography:** Technical sans-serif, all-caps headers, "Terminal" style body text.

### 2. Asset Specifics

#### Feature Graphic (1024 x 500)
*   **Composition:** Centralized "Data Core" visualization.

    *   Displays a list of repositories as "Data Nodes".
    *   Status indicators appear as glowing LEDs.
    *   Header looks like a HUD top bar.

    *   Detailed breakdown of a repository.
    *   "Graph" elements (simulated) showing build stability.
    *   "QA Status" displayed as a large holographic stamp.

    *   Dashboard view with multiple "widgets" (Build Health, Recent Deploys, Active QA Sessions).

## Technical Details
